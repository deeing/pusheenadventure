You want to go on a "Fantastic Hawaii Adventure" with the love of you life.
However, airplane tickets are stupidly expensive these days and you only have enough money for one ticket.
How will you get to Hawaii?

*choice
  # Save up enough money for another ticket (like a nerd).
    Wow. Are you really	 that lame? Go do your taxes or something, nerd.
    I hope you enjoy living your life as far away from the edge as humanly possible.
    You disgust me.
    *finish
  # Get in rowboat and paddle to Hawaii because you're friggin swoll.
    Do people really say "swol" anymore? Well, regardless, I admire your moxie.
    You manage to make it to Hawaii by sheer force of will and buffness.
    However, by the time you make it there your vacation time is up and you have to paddle home.
    Sucks.
    *finish
  # Sneak your love past airport security in a giant Pusheen doll. Obviously.
    Clearly the correct and only choice. We have yet to write this part but believe
    you me it's going to be legendary. There's going to be intrigue, violence, romance.
    Lasers! Dinosaurs! Who KNOWS what else! Stay tuned kids.
